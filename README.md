# Student Performance Factors - EDA

This repository contains a beginner-friendly Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using the **Student Performance Factors** dataset. The goal is to analyze and visualize how various academic, socio-economic, lifestyle, and environmental factors influence student exam scores.



## 📊 Project Objective

Perform a complete EDA to:

* Understand data structure and variable types
* Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies
* Test assumptions and visualize feature relationships
* Detect outliers and potential data issues for further analysis



## 📝 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following variables:

* **Numerical**: `Hours_Studied`, `Attendance`, `Sleep_Hours`, `Previous_Scores`, `Exam_Score`, `Distance_from_Home`, etc.
* **Categorical**: `Gender`, `Parental_Involvement`, `Motivation_Level`, `Parental_Education_Level`, `School_Type`, `Internet_Access`, etc.

Target variable: `Exam_Score`
